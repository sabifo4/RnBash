# Introduction to Bash scripting and R programming
This repository contains the material for the first part of the series of the SRUK Research Computing. The next subsections contain important information about how to install the software required for the workshop as well as the practical sessions that will be carried out. Note that the latter will not be available until the day of the workshop.

## Bash
If you are a Mac OS or a Linux user, you will already have access to the terminal. However, if you are a Windows user, we recommend you follow the instructions given [here](https://github.com/sabifo4/RnBash/blob/master/UNIX_terminal/README.md) 
so you are ready to follow the `Introduction to Bashscriptin` session during the first part of this workshop. For Mac OS and Linux users, we have added an explanation of how you can open the terminal at the end of the link provided above 
in case you have never opened the terminal before.

## R
We are going to learn how to program in R, so you need to first download and install the corresponding software before attending the workshop.

## Good programming practice

And last, but not least, a piece of advice for your programming practice! As newcomers to the programming world, it is easier for you to start applying from your very first code a good programming practice as
you do not have to remove bad programming habits. Therefore, we encourage you to read some tips we have learnt through our experience which have improved the quality of our coding and saved many hours of debugging.
We hope you take your time to go through them and follow them from the very beginning. You will see that they are easy to understand, easy to remember, and easy to apply to your coding style :smile:

## Practical sessions

The following links lead to the material for the sessions that will be run in the workshop. Note that these might not be available until the day of the workshop!

   * Introduction to the Bash scripting: we will code all together following a demo, no tutorial required. Just make sure you know how to use the terminal in your PC!
